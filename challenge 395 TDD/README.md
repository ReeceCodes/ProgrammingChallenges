# this challenge was to create a function that returned the count of a sequence of ones in a binary array input as an array output

 examples: [1,1,1] => [3]; [1,0,1,1] => [1,2]; [0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1] => [2,2,1]

 I did my best to start and refactor from unit tests. My notes are in the files. I started with tests and built the function to pass those tests.

Things I learned or realized:

-how to debug a test (it failed but I didn't know why because the code wasn't actually showing me anything except the outputted results)

-given the scope of this function/task I wasn't able to fully understand everything about testing. I didn't get to use exceptions* and I didn't get to refactor farther as I'm sure it's inefficient.

*I was able to make a test for invalid inputs (not binary values)
