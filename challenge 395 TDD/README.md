# this challenge was to create a function that returned the count of a sequence of ones in a binary array input as an array output

 examples: [1,1,1] => [3]; [1,0,1,1] => [1,2]; [0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1] => [2,2,1]

 I did my best to start and refactor from unit tests. My notes are in the files. I started with tests and built the function to pass those tests.
